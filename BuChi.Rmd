We have devised a novel exp strategy to temporally map cellular replacement in mice using this drug called busulfan.

now busulfan specifically targets actively dividing cells and kills them.
We have optimised a low dose of busulfan that targets HSCs while leaving the peripheral lymphocyte compartments intact.

then in these busulfan treated mice we transfer BM from congenic donors and track the donor and host cells over a year!!!!

#### The ability of a cell and its progeny to persist within the compartment over time — ‘Homeostatic fitness'.

<hr>

???
and we can express this mathematically in a simplest model like this ...

to simplify further... we can combine the cells ability to divide and turnover into one single parameter $\psi$.
Now e just have 2 parameters!!! Voila!
We're always looking to tie the maths to biological reality - you can interpret the inverse of phi as the average
lifetime of a clone, rather than a single cell.

Each model was fitted simultaneously to the timecourses of $\small log(\text{counts})$   proportions of $\small logit(\text{Ki}67^{high})$ cells.



We form a joint likelihood which is the probability density of data across the parameter distribution $\theta$ by assuming that the errors are normally distributed. 

---

<hr>

### Our aim is to update prior beliefs in the model:  $\quad \theta'$ &rarr; $\hat\theta$


$$
P(\hat \theta | y_1, y_2) = \frac{P(y_1 | \hat \theta) \cdot P(y_2 | \hat \theta)  \cdot P(\theta')}{P(y_1) \cdot P(y_2) } 
$$
--

</br>

### Sampling the posterior:
Parameters are sampled from the joint density $P(\theta)$ using **Hamiltonian Monte Carlo** (H-MC) algorithm.

  - Models are coded in _Stan_ language and fitted using the **NUTS** sampler.
  - Posterior distributions and model fits are analyzed using _R_ package `rstan`. 
  
<hr>
???
Normalized product of probability densities of both datasets and the prior distribution of params.

- This probability density is then used to update our prior beliefs in model parameters using the bayesian approach.


We judge the models under consideration based on **parsimony** and their ability to predict **New observations** which is also called as out of sample prediction error.

???
We measure this  out of sample prediction error using Leave-One-Out cross validation, in which a single observation is treated as test dataset and rest of the observations are trated as training data. The process is repeated for all 'n' observations and the prediction error for each left-out test set is aggregated to calculate Leave-One-Out information criterion (LOOIC).


---
<hr>

### Scaling the models:

$$
\small \Delta \text{LooIC} = \text{LooIC}_i - \text{min}(\text{LooIC})
$$

  - $\small \Delta \text{LooIC} = 0 \Rightarrow$ Best-fit model. 
  - Higher values suggest poorer support from the data.

Only relative values of LooIC are meaningful

$$
]

- Proportional statistical support among the models under consideration.

???
We then used the estimated LOO-IC values to assess the relative support for models using the analog of the Akaike weight which gives us the probability that a given model will explain new data better than other models considered in this analysis.

### Results

<hr>

using buchi data and statisical validation we found:

1. neutral and quorum sensing models could be rejected.

2. Equivocal support for Adaptation and selection models.

---

<hr>

### Next steps:

- We refined our models to pinpoint whether cell-age dependent effects manifest in either their rate of **loss** (&delta;) or their rate of **division** (&rho;)

--

- Equivocal support for age-dependent loss &delta;(a) and  age-dependent division &rho;(a) models.

--

<br>

### Uncertainty in model selection may arise from:

1. Sparsity in observations.

2. Batch effects and experimental variations.

3. Poorly defined models - Oversimplified or too complex.

<hr>
---

### How do we then select the best-fitting model?

--

- #### Assess the parameter estimates from each model.

> Non-physiological parameters may warrant reanalysis or optimization of model definitions. 

--

- #### Add more **relevant** data to fitting procedures. 

> Adding more steady-state data points may not influence the model behavior. </br>
> Break the models by testing them against systemic perturbations.

--

- #### Make out-of-sample predictions. 

> Assess models' ability to predict data generated in diverse experimental settings.

2. Their **life-expectancy** increases with cell-age.
  
  - Mean lifespan of youngest cells:
  
    > - CD4 T cells &approx; 3 wk (CI: 2.5-4)
    > - CD8 T cells &approx; 3 mo (CI: 2.5-4.5)

  - Time taken for lifespan to double:
