## What are the pathways of B cell differentiation? 


???
I will focus on Fm B cells ... they emerge from Tr cells. quant. aspects of the lineage transitions and branchppoints are still unclear. 

 ### .center[Very little is known about the quantitative aspects B cell homeostasis]
 
 is T1 T2 source for FMS? are they homog?
how long do they reside for on average? 

- ### Do the rules of their turnover and replacement change with age?

## B cell maturation in the spleen
<hr>

- B cells transition through **short-lived** developmental stages in the spleen.


- Late-stage transitional (T2) B cells bifurcate into fully mature Follicular (FO) or Marginal Zone (MZ) B cells.

5 % of circulation goes through spleen
blood cicrulation opens into marginal sinus where blood slows down so that Mphages and B cells guarding the sinus can filter it for antigens/pathogens.

- FO B cells typically respond to antigens presented by Dendritic cells and Macrophages in a **T cell dependent manner** and produce high-affinity antibodies.

- Complete replacement --> homogeneous 

- donor Ki67 looks higher- suggests host and donor not acting in same way - so how can it be homog?

## FO B cells turn over more slowly with host age

inter div time for both donor and host is SAME! booth rarley divide most of the ki67 is inherited.

This naturally explains there host; donor diffs in Ki67 - NOT ANY INTRINSIC HOST/DONOR DIFFS - RATHER,  soon after BMT the donor cells in the FM pool have all recently entered from the T1 pool, who are rapidly dividing -  so will be transiently enriched for cell that inhertityed ki67. But over time as the population turns over, host and donor look same. And there is actually very  little division within FM cells.

### What we learned about lymphocyte biology?

- Life-expectancy of naive CD4 and CD8 T cells increases with their age.

- Naive CD8 T cells exhibit distinct dynamics in early life and adulthood.

- FO B cells are a homogeneous population whose lifespan increases with host age.
